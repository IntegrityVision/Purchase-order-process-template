## Goal

This project was started with the automation of the Equipment purchase order process using [BPM Camunda](https://camunda.org/).
Camunda is an open source platform for workflow and business process management.

![bpm schema](documentation/bpmn_scheme.jpeg?raw=true)

Project contains additional `docker-compose.yml` for running with docker-compose (located in the folder `docker`).

## Getting Started

Before running project you have to set up developer profile in `application.yml`.

Example:

```
spring:
  profiles: development
  #Mail setting for sending notification
  mail:
    host: smtp.gmail.com
    port: 587
    username: user@integrity.com.ua
    password: userpassword
    protocol: smtp
    properties.mail.smtp:
      auth: true
      starttls.enable: true
      ssl.trust: smtp.gmail.com
camunda:
  #For correct link in email
  host: localhost:8080
  #All message will be redirect to this email. Set empty for sending to orginal recipient
  mailTo: user@integrity.com.ua
  # You can get example of this file from {project directory}/docker/data
  msExcelPath: D:/TestUsers.xlsx
  database:
    url: jdbc:postgresql://127.0.0.1:5432/camunda
    user: postgres
    password: postgres
  
```

For running with docker-compose you have to set up demo profile in `docker/config/application.yml` (this file is reduced because it has pre-setup setting).

Camunda users will be created from `{msExcelPath}` file (in docker configuration it's `docker/data/TestUsers.xlsx`). User passwords are also in this file. Don't use created manually camunda users(because they are out of organisation structure).

## Running

```
mvn spring-boot:run
```

## Deployment with docker

Before running the project in docker you have to build the project.

```
 mvn clean package 
```

After successful building there will be `iv-camunda-demo.jar` in `docker/app`.

Make sure `docker/config/application.yml` is configured, and
run next command in `docker` folder for create and start two containers (**integrity-camunda**, **integrity-camunda-db**).

```
docker-compose up -d
```

Stop:

```
docker stop integrity-camunda  integrity-camunda-db
```

Start:

```
docker start integrity-camunda  integrity-camunda-db
```

Remove:

```
docker rm -f integrity-camunda  integrity-camunda-db
```
